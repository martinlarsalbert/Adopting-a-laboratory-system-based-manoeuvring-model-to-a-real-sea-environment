\subsection{Ship scale models}
\label{sec:ship_scale_models}
The data was collected with two scale models of the wPCC. The smaller 5m model (see \autoref{fig:5m}) with scale factor 1:41 was used in the laboratory experiments. The larger 7m geosim model (see \autoref{fig:7m}) with scale factor 1:30 was used in the field data experiments. The main particulars of the two models are shown in \autoref{tab:main_particulars}. The two models are almost geometrically similar. The only exceptions are that the rudders of the 7m models are slightly more to the aft (5 cm) and that the propeller geometries are different. The 5m model was also equiped with a stabilizer fin as seen in \autoref{fig:5m} which was not present on the 7m model. The geometries differ above the water line however, where the 7m model has a large positive bow angle.
