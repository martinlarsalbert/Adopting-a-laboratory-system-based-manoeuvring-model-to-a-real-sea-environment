	abstract = {Modeling is the most important component in predictive controller design. It should predict outputs precisely and fast. Thus, it must be adequate for the ship dynamics while having as simple a structure as possible. In a good ship model the standard deviation of a particular coefﬁcient should not exceed 10\% of its value. Fitting the validation data to 80\% for short-term prediction and 65\% for long-term prediction is treated as a declared benchmark for model usage in ship course predictive controller. Regularization was proposed to ensure better state-space models to ﬁt the real ship dynamics and more accurate standard deviation value control. Usage of the simulation results and real-time trials, as model estimation and validation data, respectively, during the identiﬁcation procedure is proposed. In the ﬁrst step a predictive linear model is identiﬁed conventionally, and then coefﬁcients are regularized, based on the validation data, using a genetic algorithm. Particular linearized model coefﬁcient standard deviations were decreased from more than 100\% of their values to approximately 5\% of them using genetic algorithm tuning. Moreover, the proposed method eliminated model output signal oscillations, which were observed during the validation process based on experimental data, gained during ship trials. Improved mapping of ship dynamics was achieved. Fit to validation data increased from 71\% and 54\% to 89\% and 76\%, respectively, for shortterm and long-term prediction. The proposed method, which may be applied to real applications, is easily applicable and reliable. The tuned model is sufﬁciently suited to plant dynamics and may be used for future predictive control purposes.},

Traditional test methods of free sailing models are somewhat limited by the difficulties to mimic the effects of the wind propulsion systems or at least for recreating them at the correct scale. Simulations are possible but time consuming and they cannot grasp all aspects that free sailing models comprise. At the KTH Maritime Robotics Laboratory, a 1:30 scale model of Oceanbird was developed and equipped with numerous sensors to enable accurate and realistic measurements while sailing in unrestrained waters. The paper presents the model’s equipment and experimental results showing the abilities of the sailing demonstrator to gather high quality data for manoeuvring and aerodynamic studies. In particular, the definition of a zigzag manoeuvre for sailing ships is explained and results of tests are evaluated regarding manoeuvrability and aerodynamics.},

	abstract = {Improving the energy efficiency of ships has generated significant research interest due to the need to reduce operational costs and mitigate negative environmental impacts. Numerous hydrodynamic energy saving technologies have been proposed. Their overall performance needs to be assessed prior to implementation. A new approach to this evaluation is investigated at model scale which applies an approach comparable to that applied for the performance monitoring of a full scale ship. That is long duration testing that measures power consumption for given environmental and ship operating conditions and can use statistical analysis of the resultant large amount of data to identify performance gains. As a demonstration of the approach, an autonomous, self-propelled and self-measuring free running ship model of an Ice Class tanker is developed. A series of lake based and towing tank tests experiments have been conducted which included bollard pull, shaft efficiency, naked-hull, self-propulsion, and manoeuvrability tests. These investigated the efficiency improvement resulting from changing the ship operational trim and testing different bow designs. An associated mathematical model for the time domain simulation of the autonomous ship model provides an effective tool for data analysis. It has been demonstrated that the use of a suitably instrumented self-propelled autonomous ship model can provide long duration tests that incorporates the influence of varying environmental conditions and thereby identify marginal gains in ship energy efficiency.},

            Extracting governing equations from data is a central challenge in many diverse areas of science and engineering.

The only assumption about the structure of the model is that there are only a few important terms that govern the dynamics, so that the equations are sparse in the space of possible functions; this assumption holds for many physical systems in an appropriate basis. In particular, we use sparse regression to determine the fewest terms in the dynamic governing equations required to accurately represent the data. This results in parsimonious models that balance accuracy with model complexity to avoid overfitting. We demonstrate the algorithm on a wide range of problems, from simple canonical systems, including linear and nonlinear oscillators and the chaotic Lorenz system, to the fluid vortex shedding behind an obstacle. The fluid example illustrates the ability of this method to discover the underlying dynamics of a system that took experts in the community nearly 30 years to resolve.

	title = {Uncertainty and sensitivity analysis for the performance evaluation of ship dynamical model},
	abstract = {Model uncertainty is pervasive and inherent in the engineering field. It could bring potential risks in real applications, especially for ship behaviour prediction under environmental disturbances. The evaluation and quantification of model uncertainty are of importance for accurate ship motion prediction. This study applies model uncertainty analysis and sensitivity analysis methods to evaluate the ship motion model's level of uncertainty against environmental disturbances and ship manoeuvres. Firstly, three models are created based on the a dynamical model (Mariner) in Marine Systems Simulator. After that, models are tested on various predefined scenarios. The similarity of predicted tra-jectories and the reference is evaluated by Euclidean distance and used to quantify the uncertainty of models. Next, statistical analysis is used to analyze the uncertainty of models. Sensitivity analysis (SA) method called 'PAWN' and 'UnivariateSpline' interpolation technology are combined to identify which factors contribute the most to model's performance. The results suggest that the uncertainty caused by external factors varies from different models under different manoeuvres. SA can tell us which factors (wind angle, wind velocity, and surge speed) have a large influence to the model uncertainty given a ship maneuver. Such analyses, on the one hand, contribute operators to choosing the optimum model according to the current conditions for better ship motion prediction. On the other hand, they can pick up the most important factors for fast uncertainty modelling.},

The main advantage of the procedure is that the coefficients of the model directly correspond to the hydrodynamic derivatives. The identification algorithm consists of the IIR (Infinite Impulse Response) digital filters and RLS (Recursive Least Square) method. To discuss the reliability of the identified coefficients, the procedure is applied to a full-scale ship's data and the results are compared to the hydrodynamic derivatives provided by the shipbuilding company. Moreover, a simple navigation support system is proposed using the identified hydrodynamic derivatives. The system can indicate the ship manoeuvrable range under wind conditions and its usefulness is shown.},

Implicit models of manoeuvring motion are derived from the SVM regression instead of using the traditional methods for identification of the hydrodynamic coefficients. Data obtained from full-scale trials are used for regression analysis. Disturbances induced by current and wind are estimated. At the training stage, the inputs to the SVMs are the surge speed, sway speed, yaw rate and rudder angle, while the outputs are the derivatives of the surge speed, sway speed and yaw rate, respectively. At the simulation stage a predictive model is constructed with the obtained support vectors, Lagrangian factors and a constant. The Gauss function kernel is employed in the SVMs to guarantee the performance of the approximation and the robustness of the SVM regressor. The turning circle manoeuvre is simulated based on the regression manoeuvring models.

Good correlations between the measured and computed force and moment results were observed. On validating the numerical prediction technique, a set of systematic simulations on different size ship models has been carried out for static drift, pure sway and pure yaw tests to study the scale effects on the forces and moments obtained from the captive manoeuvres.
